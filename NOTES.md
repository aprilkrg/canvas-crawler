ran `history` in zsh, then copy and pasted the relevant results to `commands.txt`.

goal is to get aquainted with canvas asap by twiddling with the class codealong.

first iteration: 
build the queue velvet ropes that shrek walks straight through, but the dulock bobble head guy has to follow the maze.

idea garage:
- need a way to set up boundaries that the avatar can't cross; make exception if avatar is shrek 
- use canvas to create lines for the obstacle/maze walls

`git checkout -b maze`
